Screenshots are the path of least resistance to taking a visualization beyond the browser. They are the lowest quality photo in the all the layouts which were discussed in chapter 13. Screenshots leave a bitmap image in the screen resolution leading making it look blurry and unprofessional. This is a good option if you are taking a photo for personal use. In addition to this there is no room in this method for interacting with the data visualization. A pdf is another option. It gives you a scalable copy of your visualization. This is better quality than a screenshot, but not the best option. SVG gives you a copy of the visualization, and maintains its original vector data. In addition to this, generating an visualization with svg allowws for the use of editing tools to make modifications to the data set after it is taken.
