Screenshots are the path of least resistance to taking a visualization beyond the browser. They are the lowest quality photo in the all the layouts which were discussed in chapter 13. Screenshots leave a bitmap image in the screen resolution leading making it look blurry and unprofessional. This is a good option if you are taking a photo for personal use. In addition to this there is no room in this method for interacting with the data visualization. A pdf is another option. It gives you a scalable copy of your visualization.
