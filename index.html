<h1>
The Four Elements 
</h1>
<p> 
<b> A distribution <b/> of a data set is where data points falls in relation to other data points. The norm, which was discussed in out last lab, is made up of 3 main elements <b> the level, the spread, and the shape</b>. The <b>level </b> measures the central tendency of the data. An example of a measure of central tendency is the mean. The <b> shape </b> is pretty self explanatory, it measures the shape of the data. The <b> spread </b> also self explanatory and measures how the data is spread out. To help aid our data visualizations we should provide people with a numerical summary of the spread. In the chapter it explains how to calculate standard deviation and percentiles as a way to numerically calculate the spread. An outlier is a data point that greatly vaires other data points on the graph. An outlier can dramatically change the shape, spread and sometimes the level of the data visualization.  </p>
