Hello Dr. Bradshaw
</h1>
<p> 
The part of the syllabus that was most similar to the video were the “pair up” and “peer assessed” sections. Because I read the syllabus first I was under the impression the video would be focusing on the hard skills programmers need to know to be an effective member of the workforce. Because the 3 main points I took from the video were “A lot of the time is spent collaborating with different types of people.”, “Soft skills are more important than hard skills.” and “Empathy is an important part of software engineering.” I realized that I would need to take a closer look at the syllabus to make connections to the video. In the “pair up” section of the syllabus it is made very clear that working together is an important part of this class because working with others can deepen your understanding of the topic while also increasing the efficiency by which you complete your tasks. This was contradictory to what I believed computer science classes were like because most computer programmers I have worked with while at tech startups were all hermits, who rarely left their desk or interacted with their coworkers unless they had to. I will say that soft skills are something that could set a programmer apart because during my time at Parchment most of the programmers were limited by their soft skills, rather than their hard skills according to management. This video exceeded my expectations and surprised me.
