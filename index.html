Hello Dr. Bradshaw
</h1>
<p> 
A distribution of a data set is where data points falls in relation to other data points. The norm, which was discussed in out last lab, is made up of 3 main elements the level the spread and the shape. The level measures the central tendency of the data. An example of a measure of central tendency is the mean. The shape is pretty self explanatory, it measures the shape of the data. The spread also self explanatory and measures how the data is spread out. To help aid our data visualizations we should provide people with a numerical summary of the spread. In the chapter it explains how to calculate standard deviation and percentiles as a way to numerically calculate the spread. </p>
