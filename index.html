Hello World
</h1>
<p> 
I want to do this course because I think it will increase of the quality of my vessel. I am not particulatly interested in computer science but doing this course increases my chances of getting a better job after college giving me the ability to help others more in the future. My dream is to work for amazon, and to increase efficiency in the pharma market, giving people access to the drugs they need. Also I love star trek, I think it is far superior to star wars.
